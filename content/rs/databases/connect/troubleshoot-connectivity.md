If your client or application cannot connect to your database, verify the following.

## Database endpoint resolution

On the client machine, check if the database endpoint can be resolved:

```sh
dig <endpoint>
```

If endpoint resolution fails on the client machine, check one of the cluster nodes:

```sh
dig @localhost <endpoint>
```

If endpoint resolution succeeds on the cluster node but fails on the client machine, the problem is with the organizational DNS.

{{<note>}}
Can you elaborate on what is meant by organizational DNS problems? Does this just mean DNS isn't set up properly, so the user should review their DNS configuration?

What if the endpoint can't be resolved on the cluster node either? What does this mean and what should they do next?

## Client application issues

To identify possible client application issues, test connectivity from the client machine to the database using [`redis-cli`]({{<relref "/rs/references/cli-utilities/redis-cli">}}):

- [`INFO`](https://redis.io/commands/info/):

    ```sh
    redis-cli -h <endpoint> -p <port> -a <password> INFO
    ```

- [`PING`](https://redis.io/commands/ping/):

    ```sh
    redis-cli -h <endpoint> -p <port> -a <password> --tls --insecure --cert --key PING
    ```

 If the client machine cannot connect, try to connect to the database from one of the cluster nodes:

```sh
redis-cli -p <port> PING
```

 If the cluster node is also unable to connect to the database, the issue is with the network. Contact your system administrator for help.

 {{<note>}}
 What if the client fails to the connect but the cluster node succeeds? What should the user do in that situation?

## Firewall access

Run one of the following commands to verify that database access is not blocked by a firewall on the client machine or cluster:

```sh
iptables -L
```

```sh
ufw status
```

```sh
firewall-cmd â€“list-all
```

To resolve firewall issues:

- If a firewall is configured for your database, add the client IP address to the firewall rules.

- Configure third-party firewalls and external proxies to allow the cluster FQDN, database endpoint IP address, and database ports.
